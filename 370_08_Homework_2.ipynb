    "Imagine you are employed as a data scientist Olympic Studies Centre, whose mission is \"to share Olympic knowledge with professionals and researchers through providing information, giving access to our unique collections, enabling research and stimulating intellectual exchange\" (https://www.olympic.org/olympic-studies-centre).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked to create visualizations of historical Olympic data that reflect your exploration of the data.\n",
    "In addition, you have been asked to create an interactive visualization that would be suitable for use by \n",
    "someone without a data science background but who is interested in the history of Olympic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework assignment consists of three main parts:\n",
    "1. Question Formulation\n",
    "2. Seaborn and Bokeh Visualizations\n",
    "3. Advanced Visualization using Bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the same data set(s) you used in the first homework assignment, available via  https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results.  You are allowed to \n",
    "use adjunct data sets (such as the one that was used for the Bonus Question in Homework #1), although you\n",
    "are not required to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Question Forumulation (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to formulate good questions is an important aspect of exploratory data analysis.  This part\n",
    "of the homework provides an opportunity for you to practice developing this skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate three (3) authentic exploratory questions about the data, similar in nature to what was asked in the previous homework assignment's questions 5, 6, and the Bonus Question.  When contemplating which questions to pose, keep in mind that you should generate questions that can be answered using visualizations of the data.  Questions should be chosen to allow you to demonstrate your ability to both manipulate data and visualize it.  Selecting overly simplistic questions (e.g. \"What is the median age of female swimmers\") will not earn full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions should start with \"I wonder...\".  For example:  \"I wonder how the number of different events in the Summer Olympics has changed over time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest working on question formulation in teams during class and asking peers and the teaching team for feedback.  You should also feel free to circle back after you work on your visualizations to rephrase or reframe your questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Seaborn and Bokeh Visualizations (20 points)\n",
    "Create one or more Seaborn-based **and** one or more Bokeh-based visualizations that can provide visual answers to the questions you posed in the previous section.  A total of *at least* four (4) visualizations should be used, including one from each of Seaborn and Bokeh. If you create more than four visualizations, the best four will be\n",
    "counted.  The following rubric will be used for each visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 points: Excellent visualization that goes beyond the basics covered in class.  Clear understanding of the visualization toolkit's functionality, typically learned from studying the documentation and/or examples from other sources.\n",
    "* 4 points: Good visualization that uses basic charting and plotting functions as covered in class.\n",
    "* 3 points: Acceptable visualization with some errors or omissions.  \n",
    "* 2 points: Perfunctory attempt at creating a visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Adapting the ```Gapminder``` Visualization (4 points)\n",
    "Use some of the functionality from the Bokeh-based Gapminder visualization (detailed below) to create an interactive visualization that allows a user to explore the Olympics data set.  This section should also be driven by an overarching question that seeks to understand the relationship between two or more variables.  You must state this question as part of your answer to this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create your interactive visualization, think about the number of variables that you want to present, along with the number of modalities that are available to you.  For example, in the Gapminder demo, there are three continuous variables (Children per woman, Life expectancy at birth, and Population) and two categorical variables (continent and year).  You don't need to use that many variables but you should be aware that you have quite a few options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of points awarded for this section will be based on the degree to which your visualization allows the user (in this case, Chris and Minje) to explore your data while attempting to answer your question.  The following rubric will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4 points: Excellent work that allows deep and thorough exploration of the data and that can reveal otherwise invisible features (\"surprises\").\n",
    "* 2 points: Acceptable work that uses one advanced feature from the Gapminder visualization.\n",
    "* 1 points: At least you tried!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should create a new notebook for this homework.  The notebook\n",
    "should conform to PEP-8 and \"Elements of Style\" guidelines.  The final notebook should represent your own original\n",
    "work, although you are encouraged to work in groups while formulating questions and general approaches to\n",
    "visualizations."
